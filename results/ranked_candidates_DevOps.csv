  - Familiarity with Git (version control)
  
- **Partially Matching Skills:**
  - Experience with database management (MySQL, MongoDB) which could be beneficial in understanding data storage in DevOps
  - Knowledge of front-end and back-end development, which could be useful in understanding application deployment

- **Missing Critical Skills:**
  - Containerization and orchestration tools (Docker, Kubernetes)
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - Infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
  - CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI)
  - Strong scripting skills (specifically in Python, Bash, or similar for DevOps tasks)

- **Additional Skills (bonus):**
  - Full-stack development
  - UI/UX design
  - Data analysis

### 3. EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS:

- **Years of Experience Match:** Poor
  - The candidate has less than a year of direct industry experience, while the job requires 3+ years of experience as a DevOps Engineer or similar role.

- **Industry Experience:** Relevant
  - The candidate's background in Information Technology is relevant, but the specific experience in DevOps is lacking.

- **Role Level Match:** Underqualified
  - Given the candidate's limited experience and lack of specific DevOps skills, they are underqualified for the role.

### 4. TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:

- **Programming Languages:** 20%
  - The candidate knows Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, and PHP, but the primary language for DevOps (Python) is not listed, and scripting skills in Bash or similar are not mentioned.

- **Frameworks/Technologies:** 10%
  - The candidate has experience with front-end and back-end frameworks but lacks experience with DevOps-specific frameworks and technologies.

- **Tools and Platforms:** 30%
  - The candidate is familiar with Git and has used various development tools, but lacks experience with critical DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

### 5. HIRING RECOMMENDATION:

- **Decision:** No Hire
- **Confidence Level:** High
- **Reasons for recommendation:**
  - The significant gap in required experience and specific DevOps skills makes the candidate not suitable for the role at this time.
